play as a robot scrapping machines, old cars, anything made of metal, and other robots to salvage their parts to make more robots and to sell it for more parts
buy some more advanced parts, and the advanced parts let you salvage those advanced parts
higher tier progression is gated behind buying that high tier to be able to gather it more effeciently

you create new robots to go out into the world and gater scrap and disassemble parts, maybe even go mining to get raw raw materials to be processed
robots will occasionally break down which can be fixed
robots can also be melted down for metal or salvaged for boards and bolts, basically forge for raw material and salvage to recycle parts

the player can and eventually will have to transfer to a new robot body as their robot will break down
the player can change to any robot (Up in the air: robot needs to be within range of network)

maybe need to place down transmitters and recievers to extend a network to communicate with a sort of "hive mind"

game is in isometric perspective, with a click based movement and interaction system (can also use wasd and E to interact)
forge to melt down scrap and metal/plastic components
caster to make things like plates and bolts and ingots
circuit boards will be made out of copper and plastic

player has a little ui showing how many bolts have fallen out and the health of various componts, rust levels
when rust gets high enough components will fail and be unable to be replaced.
the player will have to switch to a new robot body as if they are just an electrical consciencness
